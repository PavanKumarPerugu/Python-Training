Ah, now we’re getting to the core concept — understanding **Current Working Directory (CWD)** is key to avoiding file path headaches in Python. Let me explain clearly.

---

### 1️⃣ What is the Current Working Directory (CWD)?

The **current working directory** is **the folder where Python “thinks it is” when it runs your program**.

* Python uses CWD as the **default location to look for files** when you do something like:

```python
open("data.txt", "r")
```

* If the file is **not in the CWD**, Python will raise `FileNotFoundError`, even if it exists elsewhere.

---

### 2️⃣ How CWD is determined

* **If you run Python from the terminal**, the CWD is **the folder you are in** when you run it:

```powershell
# I'm in E:\Pavan Python Codecamp
python day_7\reading.py
```

* Here:

  * **CWD** → `E:\Pavan Python Codecamp`
  * **Script path** → `E:\Pavan Python Codecamp\day_7\reading.py`
* So `open("data.txt")` looks for:

```
E:\Pavan Python Codecamp\data.txt
```

…not in `day_7`.

---

* **If you run Python by double-clicking the script** in Explorer, the CWD is usually your **user folder**, like:

```
C:\Users\<YourName>
```

…so Python would look there for files.

* **If you run Python from an IDE (VS Code, PyCharm)**, the CWD is often set by the IDE — sometimes it’s the project root, not the script folder.

### 3️⃣ How CWD differs from the script folder

| Concept                                         | What it means                             | Example in your case             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **CWD** (`os.getcwd()`)                         | Where Python “looks for files” by default | `E:\Pavan Python Codecamp`       |
| **Script folder** (`os.path.dirname(__file__)`) | Where the Python script actually lives    | `E:\Pavan Python Codecamp\day_7` |

💡 So even if `data.txt` is next to the script, Python won’t find it if you only use `"data.txt"` and the CWD is different.

---

### 4️⃣ How to safely open files in the script’s folder

```python
import os

script_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))  # Script folder
file_path = os.path.join(script_dir, "data.txt")         # Full path

with open(file_path, "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

* This **doesn’t care what the CWD is**, it will always find files relative to the script.

---

### 5️⃣ Quick analogy

* **CWD** → “Where I’m standing right now”
* **Script folder** → “Where my house is located”
* `open("data.txt")` → “Look for the mailbox where I’m standing, not in the house”

That’s why Python runs your script fine (it knows where the house is), but can’t find `data.txt` unless you point it to the house (script folder) or move to the right location (change CWD).

If you want, I can draw a **tiny visual diagram showing CWD vs script folder vs files** — it makes this concept instantly clear.

Do you want me to make that?
